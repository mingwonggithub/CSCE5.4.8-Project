What is OpenSSL? What is it used for?
OpenSSL is a software library used for applications that want to secure communications over computer networks. It incorporates an open source implementation of the SSl and TLS protocols, as well as basic crypotgraphic functions. 
 
Why are Initialization Vectors necessary? Can they be transmitted in plaintext over the Internet?
Initialization Vector is an arbitrary number that can be added to the secret key for data encryption. Because the number generated are random,the IV vectors are necessay to prevent the appearance of corresponding duplicate character sequences in the cipher text. This will make it difficult for the attackers to decrypt ciphertexts even if they are generated by the same plaintext and key. 
The initialization vector can be transmitted in plaintext.

Why are "modes" important?
Modes are important because it describes how block ciphers are applied to message longer than block. Different modes of operations can give different encryptions results with various security properties, so one must choose the mode carefully.
