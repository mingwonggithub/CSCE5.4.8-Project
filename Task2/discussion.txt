After examining the encrypted images visually, we see that when the electronic codebook mode
is used, we can clearly discern the patterns of the original image. This is because in this
mode, the message is divided into blocks, each of which is processed independently. For this
reason, identical plaintext blocks lead to identical ciphertext blocks, leading to information
leakage.

When cipher block chaining is used, each previous cipher block is chained with the current
plaintet block, meaning that identical plaintext blocks will NOT lead to identical ciphertext
blocks, and that patterns in the plaintext will not be preserved in the ciphertext.
