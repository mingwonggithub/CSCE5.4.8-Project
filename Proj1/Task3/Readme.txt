The goal of this task 3 to examine the difference between ecb and cbc mode of operations. To run the program, please follow the following steps. 

1. Run the encrypt.sh to generate zout_ecb.txt and zout_cbc.txt
2. Modify the 30th byte using ghex zout_ecb.txt and zout_cbc.txt. 
For an example, AC -> 22 and 0F -> 33 for the sample zout_ecb.txt and zout_cbc.txt respectively. 
3. The new files must be named as zzout_ecb.txt and zzout_cbc.txt.
4. Run the decrypt.sh to generate plaintext_ecb.txt and plaintext_cbc.txt
